# Acceleration and Velocity

A car is moving at a velocity of [v0]() `m/s`. The driver is accelerating at [a]() `m/s^2`. What is the velocity of the car after [t]() seconds?

The velocity is: [v](answer) `m/s`

[](solution,begin)

The velocity of an an accelerating object is calculated with the formula `v = v0 + a * t`.
