In the 8-puzzle, at each turn, you can move one of the tiles bordering the empty space into the empty space (that is, there are two or three valid moves at each turn) in order to reach the goal state:

![1.0](goalState)

Your goal is to use a ***heuristic search*** to get from the starting state below to the goal state in as few moves as possible. The heuristic to use is the [heuristic]().

The entire tree of potential moves is shown below. Calculate the heuristic values for the nodes, and tell in which order of nodes your algorithm traverses the tree, excluding the starting and goal nodes (An answer is of the form [A,B,D,G]).
